\chapter{Literature Review}

This chapter aims to critically analyze the existing literature on cloud computing and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols, focusing on identifying security risks and highlighting gaps in current research. By examining these areas, the chapter will provide a foundation for understanding the complexities and challenges of securing cloud applications using OIDC. It will also offer an overview of cloud computing and OIDC to contextualize their interrelated roles in modern technology environments.

\section{Overview of Cloud Computing}
Cloud computing is a service model that provides on-demand access to a wide range of computing resources via the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics \citep{rashid2019cloud}. These services are designed to be easily manageable and deployable, often requiring minimal effort from the user. For example, users can quickly launch servers using a web browser through Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) such as AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. 

Beyond simply running applications, cloud computing is evolving with new concepts like mobile cloud computing. One such concept is mobile cloud computing (MCC), a popular architectural model that integrates cloud computing with mobile technology. This model allows mobile devices to leverage the extra power and storage capacity of cloud-based resources, helping to overcome mobile hardware limitations \citep{mcc}. However, such models also pose latency, data security, and network dependency challenges. Addressing these issues requires robust network infrastructure, efficient data encryption, and effective management strategies to ensure privacy and reliability.

\section{Deployment Models}
The cloud offers different deployment models, each with varying levels of complexity and control, allowing consumers to choose the best fit for their needs, typically classified into public, private, hybrid, and community clouds. Security is a critical aspect that influences the choice of a deployment model; see Table \ref{table:cloud_comp} for a comparison. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{Public Cloud} - This model is the most used method to deploy applications in the cloud, preferred for running web applications, file sharing, and non-critical systems needed top-level privacy \citep{cloudmodel}. Public cloud services are also considered more cost-effective as the consumers can pay as they go. Public cloud providers often have multiple data centres worldwide, offering redundancy and high availability. This ensures that services remain available even if one data centre experiences issues. Public cloud providers also offer a range of managed services, such as databases, machine learning tools, and analytics platforms, which allow organizations to leverage advanced technologies without maintaining the underlying infrastructure. 
    
    While public clouds offer numerous benefits, security remains a primary concern. Key security considerations include data privacy and ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted and managed securely. Organizations must also ensure that their use of the public cloud complies with industry regulations and standards. Properly managing access controls and user permissions is essential to protect resources. Businesses should also consider strategies to avoid vendor lock-in to maintain flexibility and control  \citep{cloudmodel}.
    
    \item  \textbf{Private Cloud} - A Private cloud is a deployment model dedicated to a single consumer who does not share resources with multiple users to maintain a high level of privacy. The organization manages its resources and who has access to it. Some private clouds are also hosted in a local data centre to have greater infrastructure separation \citep{cloudmodel}. The principal characteristic of this model is to provide exclusive access to the resources only to the organisation, ensuring more significant levels of privacy and security. 
    
    However, the greater flexibility to customize the private cloud environment to meet specific business needs and performance comes with its challenges. Building and maintaining a private cloud can be more expensive than public cloud services due to the need for dedicated hardware and skilled IT staff. Managing a private cloud environment requires expertise and can be complex, particularly for organizations with limited IT resources. Additionally, private clouds may have limitations in scalability, depending on the organization's infrastructure and resources \citep{private_cloud}. \newline
    \item  \textbf{Hybrid Cloud} - As the name suggests, the hybrid cloud model combines both public and private clouds to achieve the best of both worlds and create a flexible, scalable computing infrastructure with the desired amount of control for critical assets. This model allows organizations to leverage the benefits of both cloud types while addressing specific business needs related to security, performance, and cost efficiency. By integrating public and private clouds, organizations can dynamically manage workloads, optimize resource usage, and improve business agility \citep{cloudmodel}.

    While the hybrid cloud offers numerous advantages, it also presents particular challenges. Managing and integrating multiple cloud environments can be complex and require robust IT expertise and tools. Ensuring seamless connectivity and interoperability between public and private clouds is critical to achieving the desired benefits. Organizations must also address security and compliance issues across both environments, implementing consistent policies and procedures to protect data and maintain regulatory compliance that requires additional tools and expertise, increasing the costs for running such a model \citep{hybrid_model}.
   
    \item  \textbf{Community Cloud} - A community cloud is a cloud deployment model where several organizations share the infrastructure with common interests, goals, or regulatory requirements. This model is designed to meet the specific needs of a particular community, such as industry groups, government agencies, or academic institutions. The community cloud offers a balanced approach, combining the shared resource benefits of a public cloud with the enhanced security and compliance controls of a private cloud. Organizations within the community share the costs, making it a cost-effective solution \citep{cloudmodel}.

\section{Risks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Access Control In the Cloud} - Access control in the cloud is critical to securing the system and sensitive data. However, managing the access control has risks, especially when the controls are misconfigured, as the cloud follows a shared responsibility for securing the systems between the customer and the cloud provider \citep{cloud_shared_resp}. Such misconfiguration of identity and access management (IAM) policies, weak authentication practices, and poor management for storing and rotating secret keys can lead to unauthorised access.  

    \item \textbf{Network Security } - Network security in cloud computing faces unique challenges that can compromise data and service integrity. One of the primary risks is insecure API endpoints, where attackers can exploit vulnerable APIs lacking proper authentication and encryption to gain unauthorized access to cloud resources, leading to data breaches and service disruption. Network security issues have a lot of commonalities with the traditional, like DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)  and VM vulnerabilities, especially with cloud sharing infrastructure where the infrastructure is shared amongst many clients \citep{network_cloud}. If proper measures and configurations are not in place, attackers could move laterally across the cloud to infiltrate many systems and organisations simultaneously. 
    
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance } - Cloud computing has added complexity as Cloud providers tend to be multi-regional, which presents significant challenges to organisations operating across different regions, and the areas are subject to strict requirements for data protection, security controls and data sovereignty. This risk, in particular, is not a security risk but rather a legal one, where not failure to comply with local laws and regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI DSS could lead to financial and reputational damage \citep{legal_cloud_challenge}.
    
    \item \textbf{Malware on Mobile Cloud Computing } - Cloud computing has evolved from the traditional web application to being used for mobile, also known as Mobile Cloud Computing. Malware injection is a significant threat to MCC. Attackers can embed malicious code into legitimate mobile applications, leading to harmful activities such as stealing sensitive data or using cloud computing power for tasks like crypto mining, also known as cryptojacking \citep{cryptojacking}. The interconnected nature of cloud computing means that malware introduced into one device can potentially spread to other devices or services within the same cloud environment. For instance, if a cloud-based application becomes infected, all users accessing that application are at risk of having their data compromised. Once malware is injected, it can persistently attack the mobile device, extract valuable information, and send it back to the attacker, often without the user's knowledge.
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-tenancy} - Multi-tenancy security risks are very similar to the ones discussed in network security, as in a multi-tenant system, an organisation could use the same physical hardware as in a private deployment model. Such a system can lead to data leakages or unauthorised access if it is improperly configured or there are vulnerabilities in the cloud provider's software.   According to \citep{multi_tenancy_cloud_risk}, an attacker has a 40\% chance of allocating his VM besides the victims using tactics like side-channel attacks, which can be done with a moderate budget, making such attacks more probable.

\section{OpenID Connect Protocol}
OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a prevalent authentication layer based on the OAuth 2.0 protocol that provides a standardised way of authenticating and authorising users across web applications and apps \citep{oidc_intro}. OIDC enables a secure sign-in experience and simplifies verifying user identities across various applications and platforms. This protocol allows applications to request and receive information about authenticated users from identity providers (IDPs), such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. The authentication process involves exchanging different types of tokens, usually in JSON Web Token (JWT) format, a widely adopted industry standard for exchanging information between two parties \citep{jwt}. These JWT tokens are then used as different kinds of Tokens, such as ID tokens, access tokens, and refresh tokens that contain claims or information about the user and the permissions they are allowed in the application and carry information about their sessions. Using these tokens, an application can authenticate and authorise users (Access Tokens), identify authenticated users (ID tokens) and provide a way to re-authenticate automatically without explicit login (Refresh tokens) \citep{oidc_tokens}. See Figure \ref{fig:oidc_simple} that depicts the usage of the different types of tokens.
