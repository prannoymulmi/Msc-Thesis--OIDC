\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
In the era of digitalisation, an immense transformation is commencing where day-to-day services such as shopping, communicating with people, visiting university courses, and also critical services like accessing financial services, accessing health services, running powerplants, managing traffic, and managing public services are moving digital \citep{intro_cloud_critical_infra}. This transformation is fundamentally changing the traditional analogue methods and replacing them with continual innovations, enhancing efficiency and improving user experience by providing a digital platform in the form of different applications/software hosted in the Cloud. For example, in 2023, the German administration created a cloud strategy plan with the German Administration Cloud Strategy (DVS) to incorporate, strengthen and improve the status quo of digitalisation in the public sector \citep{german_gov_cloud_plan}. Such moves are not isolated to a single country and signals a move towards cloud and digitalisation to shape the new world. \newline

As this modernization reshapes the business landscape, there is a need to ensure that only legitimate users gain access to sensitive data and systems to safeguard personal data as well as unauthorized breaches, which can lead to loss of intellectual property, violation of laws and regulations and disruption to public services \citep{critical_infra_reason}. Therefore, authentication and authorisation are fundamental concepts in cybersecurity, crucial for safeguarding digital resources and ensuring proper access control. \newline

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or an online service using credentials like passwords, biometrics, or tokens \citep{authetication_intro}. On the other hand, authorization determines the permissions or defines the granular access levels a user can execute, ensuring only the actions one is entitled to are used \citep{Gollmann2021-at}. Having both mechanisms to secure systems and avoid sensitive information and unauthorised access is crucial. Especially now, where the cloud-computing industry is booming, many services are easily accessible to a larger group of people, as it is easier to run and create different applications and simultaneously give attackers more systems to compromise.\newline

In addition to the benefits that cloud computing provides, such as easy accessibility and quicker setup of applications, it has also introduced new challenges. In particular, the shared responsibility model of the Cloud, where the cloud provider and the client both have specific responsibilities to secure the system \citep{shared_principal}. This complication increases the attack surfaces to exploit as different errors and misconfiguration could make the system more vulnerable. Therefore, the combination of authentication and authorization for applications running in the cloud has gained significance. 


\section{Problem Statement}
Cloud computing and applications needing authorisation and authentication capabilities are synonymous, as many systems are slowly moving to this environment. This way of operating business has been revolutionary, as it leverages a group of distributed systems located on remote servers hosted on the internet. The main benefit of using such a distributed network of readily available systems is also the main challenge for securing the system \citep{Alouffi2021-yh}. Especially when it comes to authentication and authorisation, it can be very critical as the vulnerabilities in this area will lead to unauthorised access and data leaks, which can be very costly; Statista reported in 2023 that the average cost of such a data breach is about 4.45 million US dollars \citep{statista_data_breach}. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the security risks associated with authentication and authorisation protocols in a cloud-based application using the Open ID connect protocol (OIDC), as OIDC is one of the most widely used protocols for Identity Management (IdM), which supports different modes such as mobile applications, machine-to-machine, and Single Sign-On (SSO) \citep{oidc_popular}.
