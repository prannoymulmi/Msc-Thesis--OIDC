               academia and industry. Cloud computing benefits both cloud
               services providers (CSPs) and consumers. The security challenges
               associated with cloud computing have been widely studied in the
               literature. This systematic literature review (SLR) is aimed to
               review the existing research studies on cloud computing security,
               threats, and challenges. This SLR examined the research studies
               published between 2010 and 2020 within the popular digital
               libraries. We selected 80 papers after a meticulous screening of
               published works to answer the proposed research questions. The
               outcomes of this SLR reported seven major security threats to
               cloud computing services. The results showed that data tampering
               and leakage were among the highly discussed topics in the chosen
               literature. Other identified security risks were associated with
               the data intrusion and data storage in the cloud computing
               environment. This SLR’s results also indicated that consumers’
               data outsourcing remains a challenge for both CSPs and cloud
               users. Our survey paper identified the blockchain as a partnering
               technology to alleviate security concerns. The SLR findings
               reveal some suggestions to be carried out in future works to
               bring data confidentiality, data integrity, and availability.",

                  This research aims to fill this gap by investigating the main
                  factors that influence on the decision to adopt mobile cloud
                  computing in the university campus. Therefore, this research
                  proposes an integrated model, incorporating seven key
                  technological factors derived from previous research review,
                  along with new factors (such as quality of service and
                  relative advantage) that have not been addressed in the
                  previous researches as key aspects in the decision to adopt
                  mobile cloud services in university campus. Data were
                  collected from 210 academic staff in different departments in
                  the public universities in Saudi Arabia. The most influential
                  determinants of mobile cloud adoption were found to be quality
                  of service, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use,
                  relative advantage and trust. The results also showed security
                  and privacy concerns still prevent mobile cloud adoption in
                  Saudi universities. Finally, findings of this research provide
                  valuable guidelines to universities, mobile cloud providers
                  and decision makers to ensure a successful implementation of

                  and articulation of the security requirements in the early
                  stages of software development. Although they are an important
                  source of architectural knowledge, assumptions made in this
                  context are in practice left implicit or at best, documented
                  informally in an unstructured textual format. As guidelines
                  and best practices are lacking, the nature, purpose and impact
                  of assumptions made in this context is generally not well
                  understood. We present a descriptive study of in total 640
                  textual assumptions made in 96 STRIDE threat models of the
                  same system. The study mainly focuses on the diversity in how
                  assumptions are used in practice, in terms of (i) the role or
                  function of these assumptions in the threat modeling process,
                  (ii) the degree of coupling between the assumptions and the
                  system under analysis, and (iii) the extent to which these
                  assumptions are exclusively specific to security. We observe
                  large differences on all three investigated aspects:
                  practitioners use the mechanism of assumption-making for
                  diverse purposes, but predominantly to exclude certain threats
                  from further analysis, i.e. to scope the analysis effort by
                  steering it away from threat scenarios that are considered

                  basis for threat analysis, and in favor of integrating more
                  expressive attacker and trust models which can co-evolve with
                  the threat model and the system.},

                  in more attacks, vulnerabilities, and corruption. Traditional
                  and old security controls are insufficient against new attacks

                digitalization is directly proportional to the cyber threats
                that lurk in organizational assets. So as to mitigate the risks
                that occur to organizational assets, it is necessary to carry
                out cyber risk management planning. As an organization engaged
                in information technology, ABC organization has an ICT unit that
                supports the duties and responsibilities in managing
                infrastructure, information systems, and organizational
                services. However, this unit has never done risk management
                planning for its assets, so it is likely that the risks that
                have occurred can be repeated without mitigation. Therefore,
                this research was made to design a cyber risk plan aimed at the
                ICT unit of the ABC organization using 3 security standards,
                including NIST CSF v1.1 as the main framework, ISO/ IEC 27005:
                2018 as a supporting framework, and NIST SP 800-53 revision 5 as
                a recommendation for actions taken for identified risks. From

                the ICT unit with details of 64 accepted risks and 43 mitigated
                risks with 86 control recommendations. The provision of control
                recommendations is adjusted to the risks experienced by the

                October 2022, the third edition of the standard was published as
                ISO/IEC 27001:2022 to address global cybersecurity challenges

                the lens of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
                (NIST)’s Cybersecurity Framework (CF) for critical
                infrastructure protection, version 1.1. This is because the
                security controls referenced in Annex A of the ISO/IEC 27001
                standard are prominently referenced in each of NIST CF’s five
                Functions - Identify; Protect; Detect; Respond; Recover - for
                its implementation. The author sought to establish whether and
                how the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 has been improved for enterprise
                systems security. Descriptive statistics were utilised to
                determine the frequency distribution of each ISO/IEC 27001:2022
                security control for each NIST CF Function. It was found that
                the NIST CF’s Protect Function has a higher frequency
                distribution of security controls than the other four Functions.
                Interestingly, the distribution was at 52\% for both the ISO/IEC
                27001:2022 and ISO/IEC 27001:2013. It was concluded that the
                ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is a slight improvement to the ISO/IEC
                27001:2013 as it also introduced eleven new security controls
                one of which addresses the protection of cloud computing

                  penetration testing scanners to ensure the robustness of web
                  applications. However, a notable limitation of many scanning
                  techniques is their susceptibility to producing false
                  positives. This paper presents a novel framework designed to
                  automate the operation of multiple Web Application
                  Vulnerability Scanners (WAVS) within a single platform. The
                  framework generates a combined vulnerabilities report using
                  two algorithms: an automation algorithm and a novel
                  combination algorithm that produces comprehensive lists of
                  detected vulnerabilities. The framework leverages the
                  capabilities of two web vulnerability scanners, Arachni and
                  OWASP ZAP. The study begins with an extensive review of the
                  existing scientific literature, focusing on open-source WAVS
                  and exploring the OWASP 2021 guidelines. Following this, the
                  framework development phase addresses the challenge of varying
                  results obtained from different WAVS. This framework’s core
                  objective is to combine the results of multiple WAVS into a
                  consolidated vulnerability report, ultimately improving
                  detection rates and overall security. The study demonstrates
                  that the combined outcomes produced by the proposed framework
                  exhibit greater accuracy compared to individual scanning
                  results obtained from Arachni and OWASP ZAP. In summary, the
                  study reveals that the Union List outperforms individual
                  scanners, particularly regarding recall and F-measure.
                  Consequently, adopting multiple vulnerability scanners is
                  recommended as an effective strategy to bolster vulnerability
                  detection in web applications.},

                  and how is it able to exert regulatory influence outside its
                  boundaries? This article aims to answer the question by
                  focusing on data protection laws and analysing empirical
                  evidence gathered through interviews with government
                  officials, data protection enforcers, experts, and activists
                  from third countries, as well as industry stakeholders, EU
                  policymakers, national regulators, and academics. Starting
                  from the so-called Brussels effect to provide a comprehensive
                  theoretical framework of EU regulatory influence, it is
                  possible to disentangle the structural pressures that enable
                  EU regulatory influence in foreign jurisdictions and the
                  mechanisms through which it works. As European policymakers
                  appear increasingly keen on setting global standards in new
                  areas of the digital domain, this article provides insight
                  into why and how the EU has been able to exert global
                  influence via its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
                  Empirical evidence collected in this study points to three
                  main drivers of the GDPR’s global success: the EU’s internal
                  market appeal, its credibility as a regulator and enforcer,
                  and the timing of its regulatory actions in line with evolving
                  policy needs. This has enabled the EU to exert regulatory
                  influence in a unilateral and indirect way—via market forces
                  or independent import by third states—as well as in a more
                  direct way—via adequacy decisions. The role of Member States
                  and multilateralism appears to be limited.},

                  hardware, with the host system frequently switching between
                  active tasks. Though AWS states that microarchitectural
                  attacks are included in their threat model, this class of
                  attacks directly relies on shared hardware, just as the
                  scalability of serverless computing relies on sharing hardware
                  between unprecedented numbers of users. In this work, we
                  investigate how secure Firecracker is against
                  microarchitectural attacks. First, we review Firecracker's
                  stated isolation model and recommended best practices for
                  deployment, identify potential threat models for serverless
                  platforms, and analyze potential weak points. Then, we use
                  microarchitectural attack proof-of-concepts to test the
                  isolation provided by Firecracker and find that it offers
                  little protection against Spectre or MDS attacks. We discover
                  two particularly concerning cases: 1) a Medusa variant that
                  threatens Firecracker VMs but not processes running outside
                  them, and is not mitigated by defenses recommended by AWS, and
                  2) a Spectre-PHT variant that remains exploitable even if
                  recommended countermeasures are in place and SMT is disabled
                  in the system. In summary, we show that AWS overstates the
                  security inherent to the Firecracker VMM and provides
                  incomplete guidance for properly securing cloud systems that
                  use Firecracker.}

                  innovation, allowing organizations to alleviate the
                  complexities associated with provisioning, scaling, and
                  managing infrastructure. The surge in serverless adoption
                  poses challenges in choosing optimal solutions amid a myriad
                  of proposed designs by experts. This paper categorizes
                  serverless patterns using a multivocal literature review,
                  highlighting benefits and challenges in coordination,
                  aggregation, event management, availability, communication,
                  and validation. To illustrate the practical application of
                  serverless computing, we present a case study involving the
                  use of AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and other services to
                  process real-time data streams for a fictional ride-sharing

                Infrastructure management tools have the potential to
                revolutionize how we manage IT infrastructure. However, many
                organizations today report no significant improvements, and some
                report that using these tools only makes things more
                complicated. The question of when a person will be able to

                infrastructure with code in a single step is the straightforward
                answer to the issue. Terraform allows you to write code for
                numerous resources that will be deployed on your AWS account.
                Terraform supports a wide range of providers in addition to AWS,
                including Azure, Digital Ocean, Grafana, etc. Terraform has
                significantly reduced the time and effort required for

                  transforms passwords into a secure and irreversible format. It
                  is used not only for authentication purposes but also for key
                  derivation mechanisms. The primary purpose of password hashing
                  is to enhance the security of user credentials by preventing
                  the exposure of plaintext passwords in the event of a data
                  breach. As a key derivation function, password hashing aims to
                  derive secret keys from a master key, password, or passphrase

                  various tools designed to run the analysis in different
                  programming languages like Java, C++, and Python. This paper
                  presents an empirical comparison of popular static analysis
                  tools for identifying software defects using several datasets
                  using Java, C++, and Python code. The study used popular

                  paths in this growing field. Also, we will go through the
                  future benefits of cloud computing and the upcoming possible
                  challenges we will have. Intext Cloud, performance, cloud
                  computing, architecture, scale-up, and big data are all terms
                  used in this context. Cloud computing offers a wide range of
                  architectural configurations, including the number of
                  processors, memory, and nodes. Cloud computing has already
                  changed the way we store, process, and access data, and it is
                  expected to continue to have a significant impact on the
                  future of information technology. Cloud computing enables
                  organizations to scale their IT resources up or down quickly
                  and easily, without the need for costly hardware upgrades.
                  This can help organizations to respond more quickly to
                  changing business needs and market conditions. By moving IT
                  resources to the cloud, organizations can reduce their IT
                  infrastructure costs and improve their operational efficiency.
                  Cloud computing also allows organizations to pay only for the
                  resources they use, rather than investing in expensive
                  hardware and software licenses. Cloud providers invest heavily
                  in security and compliance measures, which can help to protect
                  organizations from cyber threats and ensure regulatory
                  compliance. Cloud computing provides a scalable platform for
                  AI and machine learning applications, enabling organizations
                  to build and deploy these technologies more easily and
                  cost-effectively. A task, an application, and its input can
                  take up to 20 times longer or cost 10 times more than optimal.
                  Cloud products’ ready adaptability has resulted in a paradigm
                  change. Previously, an application was optimized for a
                  specific cluster; however, in the cloud, the architectural
                  configuration is tuned for the workload. The evolution of
                  cloud computing from the era of mainframes and dumb terminals
                  has been significant, but there are still many advancements to
                  come. As we look towards the future, IT leaders and the
                  companies they serve will face increasingly complex challenges
                  in order to stay competitive in a constantly evolving cloud
                  computing landscape. Additionally, it will be crucial to
                  remain compliant with existing regulations as well as new
                  regulations that may emerge in the future. It is safe to say
                  that the next decade of cloud computing will be just as
                  dramatic as the last where many internet services are becoming
                  cloud-based, and huge enterprises will struggle to fund
                  physical infrastructure. Cloud computing is significantly used
                  in business innovation and because of its agility and
                  adaptability, cloud technology enables new ways of working,
                  operating, and running a business. The service enables users
                  to access files and applications stored in the cloud from
                  anywhere, removing the requirement for users to be always
                  physically close to actual hardware. Cloud computing makes the
                  connection available from anywhere because they are kept on a
                  network of hosted computers that carry data over the internet.
                  Cloud computing has shown to be advantageous to both consumers
                  and corporations. To be more specific, the cloud has altered
                  our way of life. Overall, cloud computing is likely to
                  continue to play a significant role in the future of IT,
                  enabling organizations to become more agile, efficient, and
                  innovative in the face of rapid technological change. This is
                  likely to drive further innovation in AI and machine learning
                  in the coming years.},

                Cloud simulation utilizes computer services in simulation and is
                nothing more than infrastructure and software that researchers
                employ as a service. Data centres, virtual machines (VM), and
                other items can all be managed through CloudSim's administration
                interfaces. Cloud simulators are used to simulate many kinds of
                cloud applications. A product can be evaluated by using
                simulations and make unrestricted fixes to issues prior to the
                actual launch. Therefore, cloud simulator is an economical tool
                used to analyse the working of cloud components to operate under
                various conditions and workloads. Over the years, several cloud

  abstract     = {OAuth 2.0 is a popular authorization framework that allows
                  third-party clients such as websites and mobile apps to
                  request limited access to a user's account on another
                  application. The specification classifies clients into
                  different types based on their ability to keep client
                  credentials confidential. It also describes different grant
                  types for obtaining access to the protected resources, with
                  the authorization code and implicit grants being the most
                  commonly used. Each client type and associated grant type have
                  their unique security and usability considerations. In this
                  paper, we propose a new approach for OAuth ecosystem that
                  combines different client and grant types into a unified
                  singular protocol flow for OAuth (USPFO), which can be used by
                  both confidential and public clients. This approach aims to
                  reduce the vulnerabilities associated with implementing and
                  configuring different client types and grant types.
                  Additionally, it provides built-in protections against known
