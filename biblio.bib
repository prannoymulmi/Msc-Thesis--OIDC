  abstract  = "Cloud computing has become a widely exploited research area in
               academia and industry. Cloud computing benefits both cloud
               services providers (CSPs) and consumers. The security challenges
               associated with cloud computing have been widely studied in the
               literature. This systematic literature review (SLR) is aimed to
               review the existing research studies on cloud computing security,
               threats, and challenges. This SLR examined the research studies
               published between 2010 and 2020 within the popular digital
               libraries. We selected 80 papers after a meticulous screening of
               published works to answer the proposed research questions. The
               outcomes of this SLR reported seven major security threats to
               cloud computing services. The results showed that data tampering
               and leakage were among the highly discussed topics in the chosen
               literature. Other identified security risks were associated with
               the data intrusion and data storage in the cloud computing
               environment. This SLR’s results also indicated that consumers’
               data outsourcing remains a challenge for both CSPs and cloud
               users. Our survey paper identified the blockchain as a partnering
               technology to alleviate security concerns. The SLR findings
               reveal some suggestions to be carried out in future works to
               bring data confidentiality, data integrity, and availability.",
