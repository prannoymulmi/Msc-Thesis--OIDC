               academia and industry. Cloud computing benefits both cloud
               services providers (CSPs) and consumers. The security challenges
               associated with cloud computing have been widely studied in the
               literature. This systematic literature review (SLR) is aimed to
               review the existing research studies on cloud computing security,
               threats, and challenges. This SLR examined the research studies
               published between 2010 and 2020 within the popular digital
               libraries. We selected 80 papers after a meticulous screening of
               published works to answer the proposed research questions. The
               outcomes of this SLR reported seven major security threats to
               cloud computing services. The results showed that data tampering
               and leakage were among the highly discussed topics in the chosen
               literature. Other identified security risks were associated with
               the data intrusion and data storage in the cloud computing
               environment. This SLR’s results also indicated that consumers’
               data outsourcing remains a challenge for both CSPs and cloud
               users. Our survey paper identified the blockchain as a partnering
               technology to alleviate security concerns. The SLR findings
               reveal some suggestions to be carried out in future works to
               bring data confidentiality, data integrity, and availability.",

                  This research aims to fill this gap by investigating the main
                  factors that influence on the decision to adopt mobile cloud
                  computing in the university campus. Therefore, this research
                  proposes an integrated model, incorporating seven key
                  technological factors derived from previous research review,
                  along with new factors (such as quality of service and
                  relative advantage) that have not been addressed in the
                  previous researches as key aspects in the decision to adopt
                  mobile cloud services in university campus. Data were
                  collected from 210 academic staff in different departments in
                  the public universities in Saudi Arabia. The most influential
                  determinants of mobile cloud adoption were found to be quality
                  of service, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use,
                  relative advantage and trust. The results also showed security
                  and privacy concerns still prevent mobile cloud adoption in
                  Saudi universities. Finally, findings of this research provide
                  valuable guidelines to universities, mobile cloud providers
                  and decision makers to ensure a successful implementation of

                  and articulation of the security requirements in the early
                  stages of software development. Although they are an important
                  source of architectural knowledge, assumptions made in this
                  context are in practice left implicit or at best, documented
                  informally in an unstructured textual format. As guidelines
                  and best practices are lacking, the nature, purpose and impact
                  of assumptions made in this context is generally not well
                  understood. We present a descriptive study of in total 640
                  textual assumptions made in 96 STRIDE threat models of the
                  same system. The study mainly focuses on the diversity in how
                  assumptions are used in practice, in terms of (i) the role or
                  function of these assumptions in the threat modeling process,
                  (ii) the degree of coupling between the assumptions and the
                  system under analysis, and (iii) the extent to which these
                  assumptions are exclusively specific to security. We observe
                  large differences on all three investigated aspects:
                  practitioners use the mechanism of assumption-making for
                  diverse purposes, but predominantly to exclude certain threats
                  from further analysis, i.e. to scope the analysis effort by
                  steering it away from threat scenarios that are considered

                  basis for threat analysis, and in favor of integrating more
                  expressive attacker and trust models which can co-evolve with
                  the threat model and the system.},

                  in more attacks, vulnerabilities, and corruption. Traditional
                  and old security controls are insufficient against new attacks

                digitalization is directly proportional to the cyber threats
                that lurk in organizational assets. So as to mitigate the risks
                that occur to organizational assets, it is necessary to carry
                out cyber risk management planning. As an organization engaged
                in information technology, ABC organization has an ICT unit that
                supports the duties and responsibilities in managing
                infrastructure, information systems, and organizational
                services. However, this unit has never done risk management
                planning for its assets, so it is likely that the risks that
                have occurred can be repeated without mitigation. Therefore,
                this research was made to design a cyber risk plan aimed at the
                ICT unit of the ABC organization using 3 security standards,
                including NIST CSF v1.1 as the main framework, ISO/ IEC 27005:
                2018 as a supporting framework, and NIST SP 800-53 revision 5 as
                a recommendation for actions taken for identified risks. From
                the results of this study, 105 risk scenarios were obtained in
                the ICT unit with details of 64 accepted risks and 43 mitigated
                risks with 86 control recommendations. The provision of control
                recommendations is adjusted to the risks experienced by the

                October 2022, the third edition of the standard was published as
                ISO/IEC 27001:2022 to address global cybersecurity challenges

                the lens of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
                (NIST)’s Cybersecurity Framework (CF) for critical
                infrastructure protection, version 1.1. This is because the
                security controls referenced in Annex A of the ISO/IEC 27001
                standard are prominently referenced in each of NIST CF’s five
                Functions - Identify; Protect; Detect; Respond; Recover - for
                its implementation. The author sought to establish whether and
                how the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 has been improved for enterprise
                systems security. Descriptive statistics were utilised to
                determine the frequency distribution of each ISO/IEC 27001:2022
                security control for each NIST CF Function. It was found that
                the NIST CF’s Protect Function has a higher frequency
                distribution of security controls than the other four Functions.
                Interestingly, the distribution was at 52\% for both the ISO/IEC
                27001:2022 and ISO/IEC 27001:2013. It was concluded that the
                ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is a slight improvement to the ISO/IEC
                27001:2013 as it also introduced eleven new security controls
                one of which addresses the protection of cloud computing

                  penetration testing scanners to ensure the robustness of web
                  applications. However, a notable limitation of many scanning
                  techniques is their susceptibility to producing false
                  positives. This paper presents a novel framework designed to
                  automate the operation of multiple Web Application
                  Vulnerability Scanners (WAVS) within a single platform. The
                  framework generates a combined vulnerabilities report using
                  two algorithms: an automation algorithm and a novel
                  combination algorithm that produces comprehensive lists of
                  detected vulnerabilities. The framework leverages the
                  capabilities of two web vulnerability scanners, Arachni and
                  OWASP ZAP. The study begins with an extensive review of the
                  existing scientific literature, focusing on open-source WAVS
                  and exploring the OWASP 2021 guidelines. Following this, the
                  framework development phase addresses the challenge of varying
                  results obtained from different WAVS. This framework’s core
                  objective is to combine the results of multiple WAVS into a
                  consolidated vulnerability report, ultimately improving
                  detection rates and overall security. The study demonstrates
                  that the combined outcomes produced by the proposed framework
                  exhibit greater accuracy compared to individual scanning
                  results obtained from Arachni and OWASP ZAP. In summary, the
                  study reveals that the Union List outperforms individual
                  scanners, particularly regarding recall and F-measure.
                  Consequently, adopting multiple vulnerability scanners is
                  recommended as an effective strategy to bolster vulnerability
                  detection in web applications.},

                  and how is it able to exert regulatory influence outside its
                  boundaries? This article aims to answer the question by
                  focusing on data protection laws and analysing empirical
                  evidence gathered through interviews with government
                  officials, data protection enforcers, experts, and activists
                  from third countries, as well as industry stakeholders, EU
                  policymakers, national regulators, and academics. Starting
                  from the so-called Brussels effect to provide a comprehensive
                  theoretical framework of EU regulatory influence, it is
                  possible to disentangle the structural pressures that enable
                  EU regulatory influence in foreign jurisdictions and the
                  mechanisms through which it works. As European policymakers
                  appear increasingly keen on setting global standards in new
                  areas of the digital domain, this article provides insight
                  into why and how the EU has been able to exert global
                  influence via its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
                  Empirical evidence collected in this study points to three
                  main drivers of the GDPR’s global success: the EU’s internal
                  market appeal, its credibility as a regulator and enforcer,
                  and the timing of its regulatory actions in line with evolving
                  policy needs. This has enabled the EU to exert regulatory
                  influence in a unilateral and indirect way—via market forces
                  or independent import by third states—as well as in a more
                  direct way—via adequacy decisions. The role of Member States
                  and multilateralism appears to be limited.},
