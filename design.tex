\chapter{Design}

In Chapter \ref{chap:threat_model}, we discussed the threat modelling of an OpenID Connect application implemented using PKCE on a cloud environment. The threat modelling provided an in-depth understanding of potential attack vectors and risks that could compromise the cloud-based application using the OpenID Connect Protocol. Building upon the insights gathered from the threat modelling exercise (See \ref{subsec:stride}), this chapter will focus on the design of a prototype that would address some of the threats identified. We will describe the implementation decisions and design choices made to mitigate identified risks and establish a secure, scalable, and efficient cloud-based authentication system using PKCE on AWS.
